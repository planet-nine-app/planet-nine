# Planet Nine Ecosystem - Claude Context

## ⚡ COMMANDMENTS ⚡

1. **NO MOCKING**: Never implement mock data, fake signatures, or placeholder functionality. Everything must be real and production-ready.
2. **NO FALLBACKS**: When something fails, it fails clearly with informative error messages. No fallback data that masks real issues.
3. **NO GIT COMMANDS**: Never run git commands (add, commit, push, etc.) unless explicitly requested by the user. Always ask permission first.

## Overview

The Planet Nine ecosystem is a comprehensive collection of open-source software designed to create an interoperable, privacy-focused alternative to traditional web services. The ecosystem consists of three main layers: **allyabase** (backend services), **The Stack** (core protocols), and **the-nullary** (client applications).

## Core Philosophy

- **Interoperability over Federation**: Unlike federated systems (like ActivityPub), Planet Nine aims for true interoperability where users can connect across services without being locked into specific platforms
- **Privacy by Design**: Uses cryptographic keys for authentication without requiring personal information like emails or passwords
- **Open Source & Self-Hostable**: All components can be self-hosted, avoiding vendor lock-in
- **No Advertising Model**: Designed to work without surveillance capitalism or advertising revenue
- **Production Code Only**: No mock data, test stubs, or demo content in production applications - all implementations must use real service integrations

- **Emojicoding**: Revolutionary UUID ↔ emoji conversion system

## Quick Start

### Running Services Locally
```bash
# Docker (recommended)
cd allyabase/deployment/docker
./test-complete-ecosystem.sh

# Individual services
cd allyabase/[service-name]
npm install && node src/server/node/[service].js

# PM2 for all services
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

### Building Client Apps
```bash
# Nullary applications
cd the-nullary/[app-name]
npm run tauri dev

# Browser extensions
cd the-advancement/src/extensions/safari
swift build -c release
```

### Testing
```bash
# Complete ecosystem testing (6-phase validation)
cd allyabase/deployment/docker
./test-complete-ecosystem.sh

# Individual service tests
cd allyabase/[service]/test/mocha
npm test
```
