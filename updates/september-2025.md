# September 2025

Man, it's so close I can actually see the whole planet coming together. 
The big innovation of this month has been solving one of the last pieces of the puzzle, which was how to handle user interaction on arbitrary websites.[^1]
To handle this I revived my favorite piece of software of all time, and arguably the greatest consumer software ever made (mine is but a dim facsimile of the original). 
I'm excited to show it off, but it needs another week or two in the oven. 

We also got [Swedemom][swedemom], the first third-party integration up and running.
Money made from purchases on the Swedemom website go to funding a children's play school my wife and I own. 
They're largest selling channel is eBay.
eBay charges 17%, we charge 9%, that's just good business.
The question is whether we can grow over time to match the discovery capabilities of eBay. 

To see how that works, check out [this blog post on bases][bases].

## What happened

* Rebuilt the PopupsPlease app in tauri 
* Added menus and menuing to ninefy
* Created the Magicard app for user interactions
* Lots of work on the browser extension The Advancement
* The allyabase plugin for [fedwiki][fedwiki] is in development with Ward and myself for incorporation into the SODOTO tokens for [ReLocalize Creativity][sodoto]
* Work continues with the Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy project, which can be read about a bit [here][hitchhiker's]. It remains to be seen just how this interacts with Planet Nine directly, but the Planet Nine software stack has been identified as the leading identity and payments option.
* Continued to post [A Brief History of Teleportation][hfy] on Reddit. It gets a lot of views, but not a lot of interaction so I'm pretty sure it's real popular with robots. 

## What will happen

* Launch PPP app v2
* Launch parts of the ecosystem for testing
* SODOTO tokens
* MAGICal contracts
* Launch The Advancement

## Get involved

There's room for everyone in the revolution friends.
Many people I've talked to just feel overwhelmed, not knowing how to start.
Starting something, anything, is how.
As they say, the best time to start is yesterday, the second best time is today. 

We have weekly calls at [11a PST][calls]. 
And you can email me at zach at planetnine dot app.
If you're into open source you can check out [Open Source Force][opensourceforce]
And you can join the [Planet Nine Discord][discord].

If you sell stuff online, and pay more than 3.5% per transaction, get in touch, and let's save you money and pay for cool stuff.

## The monthly anecdote

Last night I saw a Reddit thread asking for what restaurant in Chicago was a 10/10.
Assuming I'd drop into a thread filled with delicious, but perhaps pretentious fare, I clicked with low expectations.
Instead the top comment was the Diner Grill.

It's been fifteen years since I lived in Chicago so to see that veritable institution respected as it should has filled me with hope. 
To describe it here would not be the place, but it represents that place that only you and the locals who have been will know.
That place with an unsearchable name, that's been some cornerstone or backdrop of more culture than any Michelin rated fancy pants-necessary establishment ever could.

You know where the Diner Grill doesn't show up?
Yelp's best restaurants of Chicago, nor TripAdvisor's, nor OpenTable's, and not even Chicago Magazine's own top 50 list includes the only restaurant I've ever been to that has been able to completely nail the exact food that should be served at every hour of the day--including three in the morning.

But it shows up with the people who know.

And those are the people that matter.

[^1]: web interactions are handled by code, and arbitrary code is dangerous, so if you're building an open system you need to handle that security for people somehow.
