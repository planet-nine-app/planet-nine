# July 2025

Launching something like [Planet Nine][planet nine] isn't like other launches I've done. 
The other launches I've done were for products, and products, by definition, have people that want to use them.
Planet Nine isn't a product, so how do you measure success?

The fact that anything was purchased, and that those purchases went to fund childhood education, even if it was in a small way, constitutes a tremendous win in my book. 

That those purchases amounted to less than $150 in total revenue, may be considered less tremendous. 

But Rome wasn't built in a day, and thus I've been prepared for a global network of semi-federated backend nodes, and associated client applications, sharing the wealth with people doing good might take more than a month to take off.
After all, marketing's not my bailiwick. 

## What happened

Still, June was a productive month, and so let's recap some things that happened.

* Launched the first [allyabase][allyabase] base at a commercial space, obviating the need for gigantocorp cloud infrastructure (found at livetest.<service>.allyabase.com)
* Launched [Peace, Love, and Redistribution][peaceloveandredistribution], which contains a shop using [teleportation][teleportation]
* The first third party integration is complete, and should go live at the beginning of July
* The allyabase plugin for [fedwiki][fedwiki] is in fedwiki's hands now for incorporation into the SODOTO tokens for [ReLocalize Creativity][sodoto]
* Work continues with the Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy project, which can be read about a bit [here][hitchhiker's]. It remains to be seen just how this interacts with Planet Nine directly, but the Planet Nine software stack has been identified as the leading identity and payments option.

## What will happen

* Been rebuilding the PopupsPlease app, and we want to start adding the ability to do menus and event ticketing
* Finally launch the SoMa app(s) that are in [The Nullary][the-nullary]
* Hitchhiker's subscriptions should go live
* There are some professors around who want to do class sign ups. This combines with an idea a friend had about using a PopupsPlease like app for adult-learning classes, which sounds interesting
* Want to really try and get SODOTO tokens going, but that might be more than a one month thing.

## Get involved

There's room for everyone in the revolution friends.
I may be cranked to eleven, but I could still use help.

And you can email me at zach at planetnine dot app.

If you sell stuff online, and pay more than 3.5% per transaction, get in touch, and let's save you money and pay for cool stuff.

## The monthly anecdote

Since Amazon started out by selling books, and then began to purposefully ruin everything it could, I knew I wanted book-selling to be part of Planet Nine from the beginning. 
So when it came time to getting this test going, of course I threw an eBook up there. 
The only marketing I've done is posting some excerpts to [reddit][hfy], and telling some friends.
To my astonishment, I've sold fifteen copies, which is fourteen more than I thought. 

Most of these, I'm sure, have been to friends, and it reminded me of a story from back in the day when I was living with my buddy Lee who was trying to put the comedy degree (he went to Evergreen, where folks can just make up majors) to good use in the Chicago open mic scene.
One night he met David Cross, and got a chance to talk to him for a few minutes. 
He asked him what the key to getting started in comedy was, and David gave him the following advice:

"When you're first starting out, no one knows your name and no one cares what you have to say so to get noticed you've got to lean on your friends. Call in all the favors you know."

Lee thought for a moment, "I don't think my friends would be all that helpful if they came."

"Well," David said, "make more friends."
