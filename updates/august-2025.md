# August 2025

So we all hate AI. 
But a big part of that is because it's making private companies money rather than the collective, which gave it its material to train on.
One of the thoughts I had for Planet Nine in the future was to train an LLM such that it could be used to pay back the people who trained it. 

As I was playing aroun with things a few weeks ago, I realized that's the infrastructure that Planet Nine provides, namely a way to pay out to the collective rather than to private industry.
So I started going HAM with AI to rebuild a lot of the internet's current players within a more shareable ecosystem.
Thus far the results seem pretty dope. 

I'm not quite ready to show, but if things keep rolling this way, it should be quite soon. 

## What happened

* Rebuilt the PopupsPlease app in tauri 
* Built Ye Olde Appe Shoppe for easily constructing apps like PPP
* Started on the Planet Nine ecosystem: SoMa apps, b2b apps, and some special things you can only do with Planet Nine
* The allyabase plugin for [fedwiki][fedwiki] is in development with Ward and myself for incorporation into the SODOTO tokens for [ReLocalize Creativity][sodoto]
* Work continues with the Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy project, which can be read about a bit [here][hitchhiker's]. It remains to be seen just how this interacts with Planet Nine directly, but the Planet Nine software stack has been identified as the leading identity and payments option.
* Continued to post [A Brief History of Teleportation][hfy] on Reddit. It gets a lot of views, but not a lot of interaction so I'm pretty sure it's real popular with robots. 

## What will happen

* Launch PPP app v2
* Launch parts of the ecosystem for testing
* SODOTO tokens
* MAGICal contracts

## Get involved

There's room for everyone in the revolution friends.
I may be cranked to eleven, but I could still use help. 

We have weekly calls (no call on the Fourth), at [11a PST][calls]. 
And you can email me at zach at planetnine dot app.
If you're into open source you can check out [Open Source Force][opensourceforce]
And you can join the [Planet Nine Discord][discord].

If you sell stuff online, and pay more than 3.5% per transaction, get in touch, and let's save you money and pay for cool stuff.

## The monthly anecdote

One of the ecosystem apps is of course a social networking app.
I originally called it BaseBook after the obvious titan in the vertical, but then I realized the much more apropos MyBase. 
Which made me wonder if there's a term for rhyming-type things that aren't quite rhyming.

Turns out there is.
With consants its called consonance, and with vowels it's called assonance.
Because you can't completely take the boy out of the man, this latter term made me chuckle. 

Because of course Zuckerberg, the asshole, would assonant his company name from a far superior product, and then like an asshole, shit all over the place.
